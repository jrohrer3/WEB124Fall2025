    <h2>A Sandy Welcome</h2>
    <p>Step onto the warm golden sand, where the sea breeze carries the scent of salt and coconut oil. 
    Every grain underfoot invites you to slow down, unwind, and leave the worries of daily life behind.</p>

    <p>The shoreline stretches endlessly, kissed by turquoise waters. 
    Sunlight glitters across the waves, promising adventures yet to come.</p>

    <h2>Swaying Palms</h2>
    <p>Tall palm trees reach gracefully into the sky, their fronds swaying like dancers in rhythm with the ocean wind. 
    Beneath their shade, hammocks await lazy afternoons of reading, dreaming, and dozing.</p>

    <p>The rustling leaves above create a natural lullaby, a soundtrack for peace and simplicity.</p>

    <h2>Rolling Waves</h2>
    <p>Foamy waves tumble onto the shore, pulling back seashells and smoothing the sand into artful patterns. 
    Each crashing crest reminds you of nature’s endless rhythm—calming, powerful, and eternal.</p>

    <h2>Sunset Magic</h2>
    <p>As the sun sinks toward the horizon, the world seems to hold its breath. 
    The sky deepens into fiery hues of orange, magenta, and violet, reflecting across the water like molten gold.</p>
    <figure class="align-right slide-in">

    <p>Couples stroll barefoot along the shore, capturing photos while children chase the last sparkles of daylight. 
    With each moment, the colors shift, creating a masterpiece more breathtaking than the one before. 
    The ocean becomes a mirror for the heavens, and time itself feels suspended.</p>

    <h2>Nature’s Sculptures</h2>
    <p>Further down the coast, rugged boulders rise from the surf, weathered into unique shapes by centuries of tides. 
    Between them, crystal-clear pools reveal miniature worlds teeming with starfish, crabs, and tiny darting fish.</p>
    <figure class="align-right slide-in">
      <img src="images/Beach_Geography.jpg" alt="Rock formations by the beach" />
      <figcaption>Rocky sculptures carved by the tides</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>These formations remind us that the beach is more than just sand and surf—it is a living gallery 
    shaped by earth, water, and time. Sit upon the rocks, and you’ll feel the heartbeat of the ocean below, steady and eternal.</p>
